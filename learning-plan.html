      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>learning plan describes how I will operate 
        within the Dev Academy Foundations and Bootcamp 
        Programme. </h2>
        <br>
      <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <div>
        <br>
      <p>
        
        I’m not totally sure but atm my long-term goal is to 
        get a job as a Junior Web Developer and be able to work 
        from home. A position where I’m able to progress.
     <p>

      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations 
        when it comes to learning</h3>
      <br>
      <div>
        <h4>Strength:</h4>
      <p>
        I think one of my strengths is identifying my critical voice. This is something I have worked on recently and had to learn to recognize as I have been very self-critical of my abilities/the way I learn which has held me back in the past. 
<br>
<br>
        I think this strength will help support me during my learning journey as self-doubt will be a big part of this course and something I will have to overcome and catch myself when I start comparing myself to others learning or being self-critical to myself.
         
        </p>
      </div>
      <br>

      <div>
        <h4>Limitation:</h4>
      
      <p>
        I think one of my limitations is that sometimes I struggle to start a task, I think this can affect my learning because I put off my work as it may seem overwhelming or make me anxious that I’m not gonna be able to understand, causing me to get behind in my learning.
<br>
<br>
Another one is managing my time. I have a habit of working throughout the whole day where my only breaks are when I eat. So a lot of the time I feel like I haven't been very efficient with my learning even though I’ve put in the hours causing burnout. I should be breaking my day into focus times so I get a balance of enough rest and learning.
<br>
<br>
I have tried to implement time boxing like the handbook recommends as my time management in the past hasn’t been the best because I'm prone to distractions. So now I use a timer for when I want to focus without getting distracted to prevent my inefficient time management. 

      </p>

  <br>
      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you 
        like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
  </h3>
      <br>
      <div>
      <p>
        I think I want to develop my communication skills while working on group projects as I know I’m going to struggle with explaining what I am doing/what we should be doing. Also when I ask for help I want to be able to explain my situation better as I feel like this is going to be hard for me because I’m nervous about someone trying to help/explain things to me that I just don’t get yet from past challenges.
<br>
        I also want to get better at balancing my time and learning things faster as I feel like I’m on the slower side. 
 
        </p>
      </div>

  <br>
      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
        <br>
        <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
      </ul>

      </h3>
      <br>
      <div>
      <p>I think the best way to manage myself to work productively is to use a timer to break my day into certain focus and rest times to keep me productive and to go for at least 3 outdoor or treadmill walks a week to keep my body moving. 
<br>
<br>
        I think when things start building and start getting to me I just need to remember this is something I‘ve never done before and there will be other learners feeling overwhelmed and in the same situation as I am. I can write a list and break down everything I have to do into smaller tasks/in the best order so I don’t have to try to remember everything in my head.
        
      </p>
    </div>
      <br>
  
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

        </h3>
        <br>
        <div>
      <p> I think the best way to get help in a timely way would be to first google the problem then if that doesn’t work make a thread in the discord on either the help/tech questions server or to my homegroup. I also can ask for help from my facilitators. 
      </p>
      </div>
      <br>
     
  <br>


  <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

  </h3>
  <br>
  <div>
<p> What I would expect from the Facilitation team would be understanding of everyone's situation and being there when we ask for help. Also to be clear with course expectations.
</p>
</div>
<br>


<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.


</h3>
<br>
<div>
<p> I would like to have the evenings to be able to spend time with my family or play games with my sister or watch a show.
  To catch up with my friends on either Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
