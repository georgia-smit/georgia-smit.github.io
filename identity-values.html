    <h1>Identity, Values & Strength</h1>
  
    <br>
    <h2>The aim of this blog is to reflect on your core personal values, 
      and your strengths and limitations.</h2>
      <br>
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p>
      
      I think I made an ethical decision when I hiked up Mount Taranaki in New Plymouth. This was one of the most physically and mentally hardest challenges I've done, this was because I wasn’t feeling my best and was very sleep deprived but wanted to do it as this was probably one of the only opportunities I would get since you need to go at a certain time of year because of sudden weather changes when you get higher up.
   <p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div>
    <p>
      I made a promise to myself before the hike that I wanted to finish it. There were so many times I wanted to give up but the decision to push myself through is something I’m super proud of and makes me feel like I can follow through/trust myself when I make a goal because turning around wasn’t an option when it got tough.</div> 
    </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  
  <div>
    <p>
          This action/decision is something I always think back on. I was so surprised how far I pushed myself to accomplish my goal and persevere and combat that critical voice telling me that I wouldn't be able to do it.
      
    </p>
    </div>
<br>
    <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p>
      I think growing up around my family heavily influenced my values and identity as they always lived by the Golden rule in life, this essentially means putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. They would always use the saying “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” So treat people how you want to be treated. 
      I feel like this has helped me make decisions about how to treat people in different situations a lot easier, as I would try my best to understand things from their perspective. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p>
      A few important values to me would be respect, empathy, open-mindedness/being able to critically think, determination and kindness. I value the freedom of being able to explore, I think this was influenced by where I grew up and how the environment around me was full of life as I lived right in front of the Weiti River amongst lots of trees and bushes with many neighbourhood friends. This gave me the ability to go kayaking across the river, camping, boating and climbing etc.

    <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

    </h3>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p>
      I think one of my strengths is identifying my critical voice. This is something I have worked on recently and had to learn to recognize as I have been very self-critical of my abilities/the way I learn which has held me back in the past. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p>
      I think this strength will help support me during my learning journey as self-doubt will be a big part of this course and something I will have to overcome and catch myself when I start comparing myself to others learning or being self-critical to myself.

    <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p>I would say sometimes I struggle to start a task and manage my time. I think this could affect my learning journey because I could put off a task as it may seem overwhelming or anxious that I’m not gonna be able to understand, causing me to get behind in my learning. I have tried to implement time boxing as my time management in the past hasn’t been the best because I'm prone to distractions.
    </p>

    <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>
      <br>
      <div>
    <p>I had an instance in the past where two workmates weren’t getting along as one thought the other wasn’t working hard enough and the other was annoyed because they didn’t know why the other stopped talking to them.
    </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      <p>
      This was affecting our team workflow and just causing an uncomfortable situation. So what I did was ask each of them if they actually talked to one another about the issue rather than just being annoyed at one another. 
      This was quite effective as it helped them speak it out and solve the issue and get our team back on track.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <p>
      Thinking back now I should have had more confidence to say something earlier as I left it quite a while before saying anything to either of them, this is because I try to avoid confrontation when it actually helped a lot when I came out and said something.
