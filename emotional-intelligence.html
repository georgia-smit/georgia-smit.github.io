      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?
      </h3>
      <div>
        <br>
      <p>
        Simply put Emotional intelligence is often defined as the ability to perceive, use, understand and handle emotions and the capacity to be aware/control and express one’s emotions. To handle interpersonal relationships with good judgement or sense and empathetically

      <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems using logic and communication of complex ideas. IQ is a number derived from a standardised intelligence test.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>IQ represents abilities such as:</h4>
      <p>
    <ul>
      <li>-Visual and spatial processing</li>
      <li>-Knowledge of the world</li>
      <li>-Fluid reasoning</li>
      <li>-Working memory and short-term memory</li>
      <li>-Quantitative reasoning</li>
    </ul>
<br>
EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotions in others and yourself, using that awareness to make your decisions. Emotional intelligence refers to a person’s ability to perceive, control, evaluate and express one emotion.

      <h3>Why is it important?

  </h3>
      <br>
      <div>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence (EQ) is important because if you had a very high IQ and no EQ you basically wouldn’t be able to function in the real world as working with people and having friends is a big part of life as well as your mental state.

<br>
<br>
I think Emotional intelligence is the key to personal and professional success and a balance of both EQ and IQ will take you far in life being good with people and intellectually smart.
<br>
<br>
A good example to represent why EQ is as important as IQ would be in a job interview. 
<br>
<br>
If you were going for a Web Development interview up against someone with a really high IQ who knew all the ins and outs of Web development, however their people skills (EQ) were lacking so they would be a hard person to work within a team environment.
 <br>
 <br>
 On the other hand, you have a higher EQ and are really good at working with others in a team but are not totally confident in your Web Development skills but are willing to work hard. You are more likely to get highered.
