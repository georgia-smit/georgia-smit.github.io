  <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs ids?
  </h2>
    <br>
  <h3>Classes:
    Use Css Class to style an element-
    </h3>
  <br>
  
  <div>
  <p>
    Classes are reusable styles That can be added to  HTML elements.
    here is an example CSS class:
 <p>
  <br>
  <img src="images/use css class.png">
  <br>
  <p>When in the CSS style element, Class names start with a period.  
    In your HTML elements class attribute, the class name does not include the period.</p>
  </div>
  <br>

<br>
  <h3>Styling multiple elements with a CSS class
  </h3>
  <br>
  <div>
  <p>
    Classes let you use the same CSS Styles on multiple HTML elements. In the example below you can see by using green-text class to the first p element:

    </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
  <p>
    <img src="images/styling multiple elements.png">
  </p>
</div>

<br>
  <h3>Ids:
    Set the id of an Element
    

  </h3>
  <br>
  <div>
  <p>
    In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.</p>
<br>
    <p>There are benefits to using id attributes:  You can use an id to style a single element and you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.</p>
<br>
    <p>Id attributes should be unique. Browsers won’t enforce this, but it is widely agreed upon best practice. So don't give more than one element the same id attribute.</p>
<br>
    <p>Example of how you give your h2 element that id of text.</p>
    
    </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
  <p>
    <img src="images/set the id.png">
    
  </p>
</div>
<br>
  <h3>Use an id attribute to style an element 

  </h3>
  <br>
  <p>A thing about id attributes is that like classes you can start them using CSS.
    But, an id is not reusable and should only be applied to one element. An id also has a higher importance specificity than a class So if both are applied to the same element and have conflicting styles, the styles of the id will be applied.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Example of how you can take your element with the id attribute of text and give it the background color of green. In the style element:
    
  </p>
  <br>
  <p><img src="images/use-an-id-attribute.png"></p>
  <br>

  <h3>Important:

    </h3>
    <br>
    <div>
  <p>
    Note that inside the style element, you always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.
</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <p>
      <h4>Best practices to remember:</h4> If there’s only one element using the style it’s best to use an id selector and if there is more than one element using the same styling, use a class. It’s important to not have too many nested classes and ids as this can affect your site performance.
